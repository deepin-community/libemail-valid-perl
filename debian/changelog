libemail-valid-perl (0.15-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Set the maintainer field to the DPG.
  * Improve the tests to 'skip' any which can't be performed instead
    of just ignoring them or faking an 'ok' result.  The network tests
    now can only fail if Net::DNS::mx independently succeeds, and the
    package builds will fail in the event of a real test failure again.
    Enhances the 'fix' for #336188 and Closes: #363999.
    Thanks again to Don for the prod to do this.

    libnet-domain-tld-perl.

libemail-valid-perl (0.15-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Don't fail to build the package if the tests are not successful.
    Some of them require network access for MX checking, which is
    good to check, but should not prohibit people offline from
    building it (and ignoring tests that cannot succeed in that
    environment).  Closes: #336188 thanks!
  * High urgency as this fixes FTBFS with no substantive changes.

  * Non-Maintainer Upload
  * Sorry, in my previous (some hours ago) NMU I moved debhelper from
    Build-Depends to Build-Depends-Indep. Marc Brockschmidt instructed
    me that it is Lintian the one to blame, not the packaging. It goes
    back to the place it previously was in.
